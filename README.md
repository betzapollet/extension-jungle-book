# Image Map Filter (aka Jungle Book)

This extension allows you to create filters using shapes mapped on top of images.

## How to use

Before starting make sure you have at least one worksheet on the dashboard and that the worksheet has some filters on it.

Then bring in the extension, configure it and start drawing some shapes!
